/**
 * The one check that talks to the real platform — and it talks to nothing else.
 *
 * It fetches the public JWKS document and asks two questions that only the
 * live key set can answer: does the console still publish the kid the plugin
 * encrypts under, and is it still the RSA-4096 key the segment sizing assumes.
 * No credential is involved, no login is attempted, and nothing is POSTed.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT part of `npm test`. A default run that reaches the
 * network is a default run that can fail for reasons that have nothing to do
 * with this plugin, and it blurs the line that matters: verification must not
 * default to sending requests at a real service. Run it deliberately:
 *
 *     npm run test:live
 *
 * A failure here is information, not a regression — a rotated key or a renamed
 * kid is a platform change, and the fix belongs in sensenova-crypto.js.
