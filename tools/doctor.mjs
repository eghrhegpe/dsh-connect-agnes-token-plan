 * The CLI entry for `dsh-connect-agnes-token-plan`'s doctor

 * exactly one answer, in a JSON file no config and no route would report).
 *
 * Run: `node tools/doctor.mjs` (human lines) or `node tools/doctor.mjs --json`
 * (machine-readable). It reads only the plugin's own state files under
 * `$DSH_HOME` (or `~/.dsh`), never a platform endpoint, and never writes.
